The gui is designed using the MVVM architecture and consists of the following components
Model: Instance representation of data to be displayed in the GUI to allow for design time editing
ViewModel: Object that is being displayed by the View
View: What you are looking at in the GUI, agnostic of the ViewModel being displayed
